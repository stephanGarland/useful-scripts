# useful-scripts

Mostly used by me with Terraform to get what I want in a sandbox environment, but if you want an easy way to get a good CLI editor
and zsh (with plugins to make it like fish) installed, be my guest.

zsh_setup works on anything declaring itself as "fedora", "debian," or "suse" in /etc/os.release, e.g. Red Hat/Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu,
SuSE...
