# useful-scripts

Mostly used by me with Terraform to get what I want in a sandbox environment, but if you want an easy way to get a great CLI editor
and zsh (with plugins to make it like fish) installed, be my guest.

Run master.sh if you want both micro (world's greatest CLI editor; vi and emacs can have their war) and zsh installed.

Run the other two on their own if you want what they're offering.

zsh_setup works on anything declaring itself as "fedora", "debian," or "suse" in /etc/os.release, e.g. Red Hat/Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu,
SuSE, AWS Linux... If you want to add functionality for something else, by all means, submit a PR.

get_micro works on anything that has curl. Probably. x86, amd64, and arm work.
